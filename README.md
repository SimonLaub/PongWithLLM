<br>
I.e. After having previously worked on a Car game, <br>it is now time to work on (with a little help from ChatGPT) <br>a Pong and a Shooter game.<br>

So, here we go. We are going to create a car game with the help of an LLM <br>
(See the original exercise description <a href="PongAndShooterGameProgrammingWithLLM.pdf">here</a>).<br>
Exciting.
<h2>Exercise 1.</h2>
We begin chatting with ChatGPT (version ChatGPT o1-preview).

Apparently, that was an easy thing to do.<br> So, ChatGPT returns with code that works out of the box. <br>
<br>
Running the game (In its final version, see below, exercise 2),<br> it looks like this:<br>

The code is here: <a href="PongIntialVersion.py">PongIntialVersion.py</a>.<br>
<h2>Exercise 2.</h2>
Next, you should try to make a small change to the game. <br>
One possibility is to ask for a version with “self-play”,<br> where the computer also controls the bat.

Where the code runs after a few minor corrections. <br>

The code is here: <a href="PongSelfPlay.py">PongSelfPlay.py</a>.<br>
<h2>Exercise 3.</h2>
After the small changes to the Pong game (exercise 1 and 2), <br>
you can then move on to a shooter game.

The code returned from ChatGPT (sadly) initially crahes. <br>
But, after a few minor corrections, <br>it is also possible to make that code run.<br>
So, not that bad.<br>
